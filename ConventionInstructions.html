<h3 style=color:blue>Below are step by step instructions to help you
	participate and vote in the Washtenaw County Virtual Convention</h3>
	<h3 style=color:blue>Convention: Thursday, December 3rd at 7:00 PM<br><br>
	1) Sign in for the meeting. As you sign in, please identify yourself so that
	your attendance can be recorded. [There is a place for this in the
	gotomeetig sign-in dialog.]   You can join the meeting from a computer,
	 tablet or smartphone at this URL: <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/800968861">https://global.gotomeeting.com/join/800968861</a> <br><br>

You can also dial in using your phone. United States: +1 (408) 650-3123
Access Code: 800-968-861 <br><br>This will permit you to listen to the convention, but
will not enable you to vote.
<h3 style=color:blue>If you experience difficulty connecting to the meeting
please call (734)-709-8766</h3>
	<h3 style=color:blue>2) In order to be able to vote, you will also need to
		log in to the the Washtenaw County Republican Party's December 2020
		convention.  Please do this early, perhaps right after you sign in to the
		virtual gotomeeting,  so we can help you deal with any
		issues that might arise.<br><br>
		To get to the voting 
	system, you will need to open up a new tab on your browser and navigate to
	<a href="https://www.wash-gop.com/convention">https://www.wash-gop.com/convention</a>.  When you
	do this, you will see the screen shown here:</h3>
	
<p>
	<img alt="" src="/files/images/site_editors/FirstScreen.png" style="width: 800px; height: 295px;" />
</p>
<h3 style=color:blue> 3) You will now need to enter the five letter password 
		you were sent in an earlier email into the
		password box below, and then click on the "Log in to this convention"
		button.
<p>
	<h3 style=color:blue> 4) If your login is successful, you will see an
		introductory screen that looks something like this: 
</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="/files/images/site_editors/SecondScreen.png" style="width: 800px; height: 313px;" />
</p>
<h3 style=color:blue>You'll see your name
		in the upper left hand corner, and then below that two links to elections.
		The link labeled "Vote in the EC election" will take you to those choices,
		and the link to "Vote on a resolution" is a poll that we'll use
		if we need to vote on any other issues at the convention.  WE INTEND TO OPEN
		THE EC Election Poll at 8AM ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 3rd.  THIS WILL ALLOW
		US TO "SPREAD OUT" THE VOTING THROUGH THE DAY AND MAKE IT EASIER TO PROCESS
		ANY HELP REQUESTS WE MIGHT RECEIVE.  We will announce during the meeting when the
		either poll opens or closes.
		<h3 style=color:blue> Below the links to polls, there will be a list of 
			everybody who has logged in to the voting system for the evening.  [The
			names in these instructions are just illustrative.  When you log in to
			the convention, you'll see everybody who has signed in so far, including
		yourself].</h3>
		<h3 style=color:blue>5) When voting for the Executive Committee begins,
			you will need to click on the "Vote in the EC election" link at which
			point you will see a screen that looks something like this: 


<p>
	<img alt="" src="/files/images/site_editors/ThirdScreen.png" style="width: 800px; height: 400px;" />
</p>
Voting is a TWO STEP PROCESS
			and this is the FIRST STEP.  On this screen, you choose the candidates
			for whom you wish to vote by clicking on the box to the left of their
			name.  You may select up to 17 candidates (you may vote for fewer, but you
			may not vote for more than 17). This is analagous to filling
		out your ballot if you were in a precinct on election day.</h3>
		<h3 style=color:blue> 6) Once you have filled out your ballot you click on the
		"Mark my ballot" button at the bottom of the screen.</h3>
<p>
		<h3 style=color:blue> You'll now see the vote confirmation
			screen shown here [We've shortened this output considerably and are only showing
			 5 of the 22 candidates we have as of Monday morning, November 30th.
			 On the night of the convention you'll see all of the candidates for whom
			 anybody has voted.] 
</p>

	<img alt="" src="/files/images/site_editors/Confirmation.png" style="width: 800px; height: 413px;" />
</p>
<h3 style=color:blue>On your display, you'll see black bars indicating the candidates you have
			chosen, and will be given the choice of either accepting the ballot "as
			is" or going back and re-filling it out.  The two buttons at the bottom
		of the screen implement those choices.</h3>
		<h3 style=color:blue>7) Clicking the "Go Back/Revote"
			button will take you back to the previous screen, and you will be able
			to re-do your choices.  Clicking on the "Confirm this vote" button will
			tally your vote and take you to a "Thank you for voting" screen.  This is
			analagous to putting your ballot in the tabulator at a precinct and
			getting an "I voted" sticker.<br>
			<h3 style=color:blue> YOUR VOTE IS NOT COUNTED UNTIL YOU CLICK ON THE
			"CONFIRM THIS VOTE" BUTTON.</h3>
				<h3 style=color:blue>We do not believe that it will take us several days
					to count the votes in this election, and are fairly confident that we
					will not have to process truckloads of ballots of unknown and dubious
				origin deivered at 3AM.</h3>
<p>
	<h3 style=color:blue>Three more items:
		<bl>
			<li>We have tested this software on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and
				android browsers.  Although it is possible to use iPhone sized devices,
				it is not easy to do so.
				<li>If two people are going to use the same computer to vote in the
					election, the second user will need to "start all over" by going to
					the https://www.wash-gop.com/convention link and logging in as
					themselves.
				<li>Please call one of the following numbers for assistance during the
					convention
					<ol>
						<li> 734-709-8766 [Wyckham or Holly Seelig]
						<li> 734-994-3480 [William or Teena Gordon]
						<li> 734-663-8408 [Lisa Gubacci-Root]
